# Four Color Map Puzzle

The **Four Color Map Puzzle** is a fun and educational game based on the famous Four Color Theorem, which states that no more than four colors are needed to color any map so that no two adjacent regions share the same color. Your goal is to color all regions of a given map using just four colors, without having any neighboring regions with the same color.
